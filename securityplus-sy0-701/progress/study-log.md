# Study Log

> Capture daily reps so you can see where your time actually goes.

## How to Use This File
- Log every focused study block (reading, practice sets, labs, coaching sessions).
- Summarize the exact objective or resource so you can revisit it later.
- Note weak areas or follow-ups; turn them into tasks for the next session.

### Privacy Tip
Want to keep the details local? Create `study-log.private.md` alongside this file - the `.private.md` suffix keeps it out of Git.
