\## Answer Key + Explanations (v1)



\### A1: C) Availability

DoS attacks are designed to make a service unreachable, reducing availability.



\### A2: A) Multifactor authentication

Smart card (something you have) + PIN (something you know) = two factors.



\### A3: B) Firewall

A firewall blocks unwanted traffic (preventive). IDS and SIEM are typically detective; log review is detective.



\### A4: C) All access must be continuously verified

Zero Trust = “never trust, always verify” (even for internal traffic).



\### A5: C) Risk

Risk is commonly framed as likelihood × impact.
