\## Questions



\### Q1 — Virus vs Worm



Which option BEST describes a worm?



A) Requires a user to run an infected file to spread  

B) Self-replicates and spreads across networks without user action  

C) Hides inside a legitimate program but does not replicate  

D) Encrypts files and demands payment



---

A user installs a “free PDF converter” that looks legitimate, but it silently installs a backdoor. This is MOST likely:



A) Trojan  

B) Worm  

C) Logic bomb  

D) Rootkit



---



\### Q3 — Phishing Recognition



An employee receives an email from “IT Support” stating their account will be disabled in 30 minutes unless they click a link and log in. This is BEST described as:



A) Tailgating  

B) Phishing  

C) Pretexting  

D) Watering hole attack



---



\### Q4 — Best Mitigation



A company is hit by credential stuffing attacks against its customer portal. Which control MOST directly reduces successful logins using stolen passwords?



A) Network segmentation  

B) Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  

C) Full disk encryption  

D) Data loss prevention (DLP)



---



\### Q5 — Vulnerability vs Threat



Which statement is MOST accurate?



A) A vulnerability is an attacker targeting a system  

B) A threat is a weakness in software  

C) A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited  

D) A threat is the same as risk



---



\### Q6 — Ransomware Resilience



Which action MOST improves recovery from ransomware without paying the attacker?



A) Disable all user accounts  

B) Maintain tested offline/immutable backups  

C) Enforce password rotation every week  

D) Block all inbound network traffic



---



\### Q7 — Identifying a MitM



Users report that they are occasionally redirected to a fake login page on public Wi-Fi even when they type the correct website URL. This is MOST consistent with:



A) Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack  

B) SQL injection  

C) Cross-site scripting (XSS)  

D) ARP spoofing is impossible on Wi-Fi



---



\### Q8 — Patch Priority



A critical vulnerability is discovered in a public-facing web server. Exploit code is already available online. What is the BEST next step?



A) Wait for the next scheduled maintenance window  

B) Patch immediately or apply compensating controls to reduce exposure  

C) Conduct user awareness training  

D) Disable endpoint antivirus



---



\### Q9 — Password Spraying



A system shows many failed logins across many accounts, each with only a few attempts using common passwords. This is MOST likely:



A) Brute force  

B) Password spraying  

C) Dictionary attack against one account  

D) Credential stuffing



---



\### Q10 — Social Engineering Clue



An attacker calls the help desk, claims to be a new executive, and insists they need a password reset immediately. The attacker uses urgency and authority. This is BEST described as:



A) Pretexting  

B) Spear phishing  

C) Shoulder surfing  

D) Whaling requires email only



---



\## Answer Key \& Explanations



\### Q1

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Self-replicates and spreads across networks without user action  

Worms spread without needing a user to run something. Viruses typically require user action to execute/spread.



\### Q2

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* A — Trojan  

A trojan appears legitimate but performs malicious actions (like installing a backdoor).



\### Q3

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Phishing  

It uses urgency and a login link to steal credentials. Pretexting is broader and often involves a fabricated story, but the classic “click and log in now” is phishing.



\### Q4

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  

Credential stuffing uses real stolen passwords. MFA blocks most unauthorized logins even if the password is correct.



\### Q5

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* C — A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited  

Threat = something that could exploit a weakness. Vulnerability = the weakness. Risk = likelihood + impact.



\### Q6

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Maintain tested offline/immutable backups  

Backups are the difference between “restore” and “pay.” Tested matters because untested backups fail at the worst moment.



\### Q7

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* A — Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack  

The scenario suggests interception/redirection. (ARP spoofing is one way to perform MitM, but the best high-level label here is MitM.)



\### Q8

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Patch immediately or apply compensating controls to reduce exposure  

Public-facing + exploit available = high urgency. If patching isn’t immediate, reduce exposure (e.g., WAF rule, restrict access, disable vulnerable feature).



\### Q9

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Password spraying  

Spraying is few attempts across many accounts to avoid lockouts. Brute force is many attempts against one/few accounts.



\### Q10

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* A — Pretexting  

This is a fabricated identity + pressure to force an action. “Whaling” is a target type (executive), not the method, and it’s not limited to email.
