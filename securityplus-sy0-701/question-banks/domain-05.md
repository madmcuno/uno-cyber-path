\## Answer Key \& Explanations



\### Q1

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Policies state what; procedures describe how  

Policy = rule/requirement. Procedure = steps.



\### Q2

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* C — Risk acceptance  

They accept the risk because the cost to fix outweighs expected loss.



\### Q3

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Due diligence + contractual controls  

Third parties expand your risk surface; contracts and reviews enforce expectations.



\### Q4

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Reduce human-driven risk  

Training improves recognition (phishing) and safe behavior, complementing controls.



\### Q5

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Determines handling/protection needs  

Classification drives what controls apply and how data must be handled.



\### Q6

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* A — Track/review changes to reduce unintended risk  

It helps prevent risky, unreviewed changes and supports accountability.



\### Q7

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Verify compliance and control effectiveness  

Audits evaluate whether controls exist and work as intended.



\### Q8

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Legal + designated leadership/comms  

External statements have legal, regulatory, and reputational consequences.



\### Q9

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* B — Business Impact Analysis (BIA)  

BIA identifies critical processes and recovery priorities.



\### Q10

\*\*Correct Answer:\*\* A — MTTD decreasing  

Faster detection is a key operational improvement indicator.
