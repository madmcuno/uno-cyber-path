\## Core Security Principles



\### CIA Triad



\*\*Confidentiality\*\*  

Ensures information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.  

Common controls: encryption, access controls, data classification.



\*\*Integrity\*\*  

Ensures data is accurate and has not been improperly modified.  

Common controls: hashing, digital signatures, checksums.



\*\*Availability\*\*  

Ensures systems and data are accessible when needed.  

Common controls: redundancy, backups, fault tolerance, DDoS protection.



> Exam Tip: DoS attacks primarily target \*\*availability\*\*.



---



\### AAA Framework



\*\*Authentication\*\* — Who you are  

Examples: passwords, smart cards, biometrics.



\*\*Authorization\*\* — What you can access  

Examples: file permissions, RBAC, ACLs.



\*\*Accounting\*\* — What you did  

Examples: logs, audit trails, session records.



> Exam Tip: Questions often test confusion between authentication and authorization.

\## Security Concepts \& Models



\### Least Privilege

Users and systems should have only the access required to perform their tasks.



\- Reduces blast radius

\- Limits insider threat damage

\- Frequently tested in scenario questions



---



\### Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security controls protect assets.



\- Prevents single point of failure

\- Includes technical, administrative, and physical controls

\- One control failing should not equal compromise



---



\### Zero Trust

Assumes no implicit trust, even for internal users or systems.



Core ideas:

\- Continuous verification

\- Least privilege

\- Strong identity controls

\- Network segmentation



> Phrase to remember: \*\*“Never trust, always verify.”\*\*

\## Security Controls



\### Control Categories



\*\*Administrative\*\*  

Policies, procedures, training, background checks.



\*\*Technical\*\*  

Firewalls, IDS/IPS, encryption, authentication systems.



\*\*Physical\*\*  

Locks, cameras, guards, badge readers.



---



\### Control Functions



\*\*Preventive\*\* — Stop incidents before they happen  

Examples: firewalls, access controls.



\*\*Detective\*\* — Identify incidents after they occur  

Examples: logging, monitoring, IDS.



\*\*Corrective\*\* — Fix issues after detection  

Examples: patching, reimaging systems.



\*\*Compensating\*\* — Alternative controls when ideal controls aren’t possible  

Examples: badge readers when door locks fail.



> Exam Tip: Compensating controls appear often in “temporary fix” scenarios.

\## Risk Concepts



\*\*Threat\*\*  

Anything capable of exploiting a vulnerability.



\*\*Vulnerability\*\*  

A weakness that can be exploited.



\*\*Risk\*\*  

The likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.



\*\*Impact\*\*  

The potential damage if exploitation occurs.



\*\*Likelihood\*\*  

The probability of exploitation.
