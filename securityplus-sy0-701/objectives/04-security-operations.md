\# Domain 4 — Security Operations



This domain is about detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.



---



\## Core Ideas You Must Understand



\### Incident Response Flow

What it is:  

Preparing for, identifying, containing, eradicating, and recovering from incidents.



Why it matters:  

Bad response causes more damage than the attack itself.



How it shows up on the exam:  

“What is the FIRST step?” or “BEST next action?” scenarios.



Common mistakes:

\- Jumping straight to cleanup

\- Forgetting evidence preservation



---



\### Detection vs Prevention

What it is:  

Some controls alert; others block.



Why it matters:  

Knowing what a tool does avoids wrong answers.



How it shows up on the exam:  

IDS vs IPS, SIEM alerts, log monitoring.



Common mistakes:

\- Assuming alerts stop attacks

\- Treating detection as failure



---



\### Logging and Monitoring

What it is:  

Collecting and reviewing logs to spot abnormal behavior.



Why it matters:  

You can’t respond to what you can’t see.



How it shows up on the exam:  

Authentication logs, SIEM correlation, audit trails.



Common mistakes:

\- Ignoring logs until after an incident

\- Choosing the wrong log source



---



\### Containment and Evidence Handling

What it is:  

Stopping spread while preserving evidence.



Why it matters:  

Destroying evidence kills root-cause analysis.



How it shows up on the exam:  

Isolating systems, forensic imaging, chain of custody.



Common mistakes:

\- Reimaging too early

\- Powering off systems without justification



---



\### Backups and Recovery

What it is:  

Restoring systems and data after incidents.



Why it matters:  

Backups are the ransomware exit plan.



How it shows up on the exam:  

Offline backups, restore testing, recovery priorities.



Common mistakes:

\- Backups on the same system

\- Never testing restores



---



\## Key Takeaways

\- Response order matters

\- Detection is not prevention

\- Logs are evidence

\- Backups only work if they can’t be encrypted too
